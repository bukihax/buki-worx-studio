  Only update styling and light layout support where necessary.             
                                                                            
  Design goals:                                                             
                                                                            
  Cinematic, immersive look with a dark luxury theme                        
                                                                            
  Seamless, continuous vertical scrolling experience                        
                                                                            
  Full-viewport hero section on the home page (height: 100vh)               
                                                                            
  Edge-to-edge sections (no boxed containers or visible borders)            
                                                                            
  Bold, modern sans-serif typography with uppercase headlines               
                                                                            
  High-contrast call-to-action buttons                                      
                                                                            
  Minimal fixed navigation bar at the top                                   
                                                                            
  CSS requirements:                                                         
                                                                            
  Add scroll-behavior: smooth for seamless scrolling                        
                                                                            
  Use dark backgrounds (black/charcoal) with deep red or warm accent tones  
                                                                            
  Use large spacing and consistent padding to create flow between sections  
                                                                            
  Remove harsh section separators                                           
                                                                            
  Add subtle CSS-based fade-in or slide-in animations on scroll             
                                                                            
  Ensure responsive design for mobile and desktop                           
                                                                            
  Technical constraints:                                                    
                                                                            
  Modify styles.css primarily                                               
                                                                            
  Only add small class names to HTML if absolutely required                 
                                                                            
  No external frameworks (no Bootstrap, no Tailwind)                        
                                                                            
  Keep the site static and deployable                                       
                                                                            
  The final result should feel premium, confident, modern, and immersive,   
  similar to a luxury boutique fitness brand, while remaining clean,        
  readable, and professional.

● Perfect! I've completely refined the BUKI-WORX STUDIO website with a high-end
  luxury boutique fitness aesthetic. Here's what's been transformed:

  🎨 Design Refinements Applied:

  Color & Theme

  - Dark luxury background (#0f0f0f with gradients)
  - Warm rust/red accent color (#ff6b5b) replacing the previous pink
  - High-contrast text on dark backgrounds for readability
  - Subtle accent glows and radial gradients for cinema feel

  Hero Section

  - Full-viewport immersive hero (100vh minimum)
  - Animated floating radial gradient background
  - Staggered fade-in animations on text and image
  - Seamless transition to next section

  Navigation

  - Minimal, fixed header with glass-morphism effect (blur + transparency)
  - Uppercase nav links with refined styling
  - Smooth underline animation on active state
  - Responsive collapse for mobile

  Typography

  - Bold, uppercase headlines (700-900 weight)
  - Increased letter-spacing for luxury feel
  - Larger font sizes (h1: 3.5rem, h2: 2.8rem)
  - Improved line-height for dark backgrounds

  Sections & Layout

  - Edge-to-edge design - No contained boxes, full-width sections
  - Removed borders - Replaced with subtle colored top-borders and accent lines
  - Large, consistent spacing - 6rem padding on sections for flow
  - Seamless scrolling - No harsh dividers, continuous experience

  Interactive Elements

  - High-contrast CTAs - Bold warm red with glowing shadows
  - Smooth transitions - All elements have 0.4s ease animations
  - Hover effects - Cards lift up with enhanced glow on hover
  - Difficulty readers - Glowing filled dots with improved visibility

  Cards & Components

  - Semi-transparent dark backgrounds (rgba with 3-8% opacity)
  - Colored top-borders instead of left-borders
  - Enhanced hover states with elevation and glow
  - Consistent animation stagger delays

  Footer

  - Gradient background matching overall theme
  - Uppercase section titles in accent color
  - Refined social link styling with letter-spacing animation

  Responsive Design

  - Mobile-first approach maintained
  - Fixed header adapts to mobile viewport
  - Sections scale padding based on breakpoints
  - Touch-friendly form inputs (16px font to prevent auto-zoom)

  ✨ Key CSS Features Added:

  /* Smooth scrolling already enabled */
  scroll-behavior: smooth;

  /* Cinematic animations */
  @keyframes fadeInUp { ... }
  @keyframes fadeInLeft { ... }
  @keyframes fadeInRight { ... }
  @keyframes floatBg { ... }
  @keyframes slideInWidth { ... }

  /* Glass-morphism header */
  backdrop-filter: blur(12px);

  /* Responsive safe-areas for notch devices */
  padding-top: env(safe-area-inset-top);

  The website now feels premium, confident, and immersive — like luxury fitness 
  brands such as Barry's, SoulCycle, or Alo Yoga. All animations are pure CSS,
  fully responsive, and the site remains static and deployable with zero
  external dependencies.

● Perfect! I've successfully integrated the full-screen video hero into the
  BUKI-WORX STUDIO homepage. Here's what was implemented:

  🎬 Changes Made

  index.html Updates:

  - Replaced the static <img> with an HTML5 <video> element
  - Added video attributes: autoplay, muted, loop, playsinline
  - Set video source to: images/BUKI-WORX.mp4
  - Added .hero-overlay div for darkening the video for text readability
  - Maintained all hero text and CTA button content unchanged
  - Included fallback text for older browsers

  styles.css Updates:

  Video Positioning:

  .hero-video {
      position: absolute;
      top: 0;
      left: 0;
      width: 100%;
      height: 100%;
      object-fit: cover;
      z-index: 0;
  }

  Dark Overlay for Readability:

  .hero-overlay {
      position: absolute;
      top: 0;
      left: 0;
      width: 100%;
      height: 100%;
      background: rgba(15, 15, 15, 0.55);
      z-index: 1;
      pointer-events: none;
  }

  Layering:

  - Z-index 0: Video (background)
  - Z-index 1: Overlay (text protection)
  - Z-index 2: Hero content (foreground)

  Fallback Background:

  background-image: url('https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1534438327276-14e5300
  c3a48?w=1200&h=800&fit=crop');
  background-size: cover;
  background-position: center;
  If the video fails to load, an Unsplash image displays instead.

  Responsive Adjustments:

  - Tablet (768px): Overlay darkened to rgba(15, 15, 15, 0.6), content centered
  - Mobile (480px): Overlay darkened further to rgba(15, 15, 15, 0.65), text
  centered and scaled down

  ✨ Features:

  ✅ Video autoplays, is muted, loops infinitely
  ✅ playsinline enabled for mobile browsers
  ✅ Fills entire hero viewport with object-fit: cover
  ✅ Semi-transparent overlay ensures text readability across all devices
  ✅ Hero text and CTA remain on top with proper z-index layering
  ✅ Fixed navigation stays visible and readable
  ✅ CSS fallback background image if video fails
  ✅ Fully responsive (mobile, tablet, desktop)
  ✅ No external libraries or frameworks
  ✅ Cinematic, premium feel with smooth animations

  The hero section now delivers a full-screen cinematic experience while
  maintaining excellent text readability and professional design. The video
  creates an immersive luxury fitness aesthetic that matches the refined styling
   of the rest of the site.

  CSS requirements:                                                         
                                                                            
  Add scroll-behavior: smooth for seamless scrolling

  Add subtle CSS-based fade-in or slide-in animations on scroll             
                                                                            
  Ensure responsive design for mobile and desktop

  Modify styles.css primarily                                               
                                                                            
  Only add small class names to HTML if absolutely required                 
                                                                            
  No external frameworks (no Bootstrap, no Tailwind)                        
                                                                            
  Keep the site static and deployable                                       
                                                                            
  The final result should feel premium, confident, modern, and immersive,   
  similar to a luxury boutique fitness brand, while remaining clean,        
  readable, and professional.

● Perfect! I've completely refined the BUKI-WORX STUDIO website with a high-end
  luxury boutique fitness aesthetic. Here's what's been transformed:

  🎨 Design Refinements Applied:

  Color & Theme

  - Dark luxury background (#0f0f0f with gradients)
  - Warm rust/red accent color (#ff6b5b) replacing the previous pink
  - High-contrast text on dark backgrounds for readability
  - Subtle accent glows and radial gradients for cinema feel

  Hero Section

  - Full-viewport immersive hero (100vh minimum)
  - Animated floating radial gradient background
  - Staggered fade-in animations on text and image
  - Seamless transition to next section

  Navigation

  - Minimal, fixed header with glass-morphism effect (blur + transparency)
  - Uppercase nav links with refined styling
  - Smooth underline animation on active state
  - Responsive collapse for mobile

  Typography

  - Bold, uppercase headlines (700-900 weight)
  - Increased letter-spacing for luxury feel
  - Larger font sizes (h1: 3.5rem, h2: 2.8rem)
  - Improved line-height for dark backgrounds

  Sections & Layout

  - Edge-to-edge design - No contained boxes, full-width sections
  - Removed borders - Replaced with subtle colored top-borders and accent lines
  - Large, consistent spacing - 6rem padding on sections for flow
  - Seamless scrolling - No harsh dividers, continuous experience

  Interactive Elements

  - High-contrast CTAs - Bold warm red with glowing shadows
  - Smooth transitions - All elements have 0.4s ease animations
  - Hover effects - Cards lift up with enhanced glow on hover
  - Difficulty readers - Glowing filled dots with improved visibility

  Cards & Components

  - Semi-transparent dark backgrounds (rgba with 3-8% opacity)
  - Colored top-borders instead of left-borders
  - Enhanced hover states with elevation and glow
  - Consistent animation stagger delays

  Footer

  - Gradient background matching overall theme
  - Uppercase section titles in accent color
  - Refined social link styling with letter-spacing animation

  Responsive Design

  - Mobile-first approach maintained
  - Fixed header adapts to mobile viewport
  - Sections scale padding based on breakpoints
  - Touch-friendly form inputs (16px font to prevent auto-zoom)

  ✨ Key CSS Features Added:

  /* Smooth scrolling already enabled */
  scroll-behavior: smooth;

  /* Cinematic animations */
  @keyframes fadeInUp { ... }
  @keyframes fadeInLeft { ... }
  @keyframes fadeInRight { ... }
  @keyframes floatBg { ... }
  @keyframes slideInWidth { ... }

  /* Glass-morphism header */
  backdrop-filter: blur(12px);

  /* Responsive safe-areas for notch devices */
  padding-top: env(safe-area-inset-top);

  The website now feels premium, confident, and immersive — like luxury fitness 
  brands such as Barry's, SoulCycle, or Alo Yoga. All animations are pure CSS,
  fully responsive, and the site remains static and deployable with zero
  external dependencies.

  Video should fully cover the hero area using object-fit: cover            
                                                                            
  Hero section must fill the viewport height (100vh)                        
                                                                            
  Add a dark, semi-transparent overlay above the video to ensure text       
  readability                                                               
                                                                            
  Hero text and call-to-action must appear layered on top of the video      
                                                                            
  Fallback behavior:                                                        
                                                                            
  If the video fails to load, show a CSS background image fallback          
                                                                            
  Keep all existing hero text and content unchanged                         
                                                                            
  Styling & UX:                                                             
                                                                            
  Ensure the fixed navigation remains visible and readable over the video   
                                                                            
  Maintain responsive behavior across mobile and desktop                    
                                                                            
  Do not add external libraries or frameworks                               
                                                                            
  Files allowed to change:                                                  
                                                                            
  index.html (hero markup only)                                             
                                                                            
  styles.css (video positioning, overlay, layering, typography)             
                                                                            
  Do NOT modify site content or remove sections.                            
  The final result should feel cinematic, premium, and seamless.

● Perfect! I've successfully integrated the full-screen video hero into the
  BUKI-WORX STUDIO homepage. Here's what was implemented:

  🎬 Changes Made

  index.html Updates:

  - Replaced the static <img> with an HTML5 <video> element
  - Added video attributes: autoplay, muted, loop, playsinline
  - Set video source to: images/BUKI-WORX.mp4
  - Added .hero-overlay div for darkening the video for text readability
  - Maintained all hero text and CTA button content unchanged
  - Included fallback text for older browsers

  styles.css Updates:

  Video Positioning:

  .hero-video {
      position: absolute;
      top: 0;
      left: 0;
      width: 100%;
      height: 100%;
      object-fit: cover;
      z-index: 0;
  }

  Dark Overlay for Readability:

  .hero-overlay {
      position: absolute;
      top: 0;
      left: 0;
      width: 100%;
      height: 100%;
      background: rgba(15, 15, 15, 0.55);
      z-index: 1;
      pointer-events: none;
  }

  Layering:

  - Z-index 0: Video (background)
  - Z-index 1: Overlay (text protection)
  - Z-index 2: Hero content (foreground)

  Fallback Background:

  background-image: url('https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1534438327276-14e5300
  c3a48?w=1200&h=800&fit=crop');
  background-size: cover;
  background-position: center;
  If the video fails to load, an Unsplash image displays instead.

  Responsive Adjustments:

  - Tablet (768px): Overlay darkened to rgba(15, 15, 15, 0.6), content centered
  - Mobile (480px): Overlay darkened further to rgba(15, 15, 15, 0.65), text
  centered and scaled down

  ✨ Features:

  ✅ Video autoplays, is muted, loops infinitely
  ✅ playsinline enabled for mobile browsers
  ✅ Fills entire hero viewport with object-fit: cover
  ✅ Semi-transparent overlay ensures text readability across all devices
  ✅ Hero text and CTA remain on top with proper z-index layering
  ✅ Fixed navigation stays visible and readable
  ✅ CSS fallback background image if video fails
  ✅ Fully responsive (mobile, tablet, desktop)
  ✅ No external libraries or frameworks
  ✅ Cinematic, premium feel with smooth animations

  The hero section now delivers a full-screen cinematic experience while
  maintaining excellent text readability and professional design. The video
  creates an immersive luxury fitness aesthetic that matches the refined styling
   of the rest of the site.
